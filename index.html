    <h1>ITMD 541 - Lab 1 - Leslie Esquivel</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Leslie Esquivel, I am a fourth year Computer Science student. I am in the Coterminal Program pursing my Masters Degree in ITM. My programming experience consists of languages I have learned in other computer science classes such as R, Python, and OCaml. I took ITMD361 where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and briefly covered JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Get to Know Me!</h2>
    <p>I am 21 years old, and plan on graduating Spring 2026. I am the second oldest in my family, with an older brother and a younger sister and brother. I recently adopted a kitten who's name is Cheeto (he is orange, like a Cheeto). I am an adventurous person, often being referred to an adrenaline junkie. I love rollercoasters and have been skydiving twice already.</p>

    <h2>About the Class</h2>e</h2>
    <p>ITMD541 is about Web Application Foundations. So far, we have covered the history of the internet, along with the history and introduction of HTML and CSS. From my personal experience, I learned the basics of the HTML and CSS with a very basic understanding of JavaScript. I believe I still need a lot of improvement with HTML and CSS but know that will come with practice. I also have experience with the basics of different programming languages such as Python, R, and Java. Currently in another class I am learning OCaml. I am excited to be able to practice HTML and CSS more, along with getting to understand JavaScript more thoroughly.</p>
