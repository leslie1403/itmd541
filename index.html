    <h1>ITMD 541 - Lab 1 - Leslie Esquivel</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Leslie Esquivel, I am a fourth year Computer Science student. I am in the Coterminal Program pursing my Masters Degree in ITM. My programming experience consists of languages I have learned in other computer science classes such as R, Python, and OCaml. I took ITMD361 where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and briefly covered JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>Get to Know Me!</h2>
    <p>I am 21 years old, and plan on graduating Spring 2026. I am the second oldest in my family, with an older brother and a younger sister and brother. I recently adopted a kitten who's name is Cheeto (he is orange, like a Cheeto). I am an adventurous person, often being referred to an adrenaline junkie. I love rollercoasters and have been skydiving twice already.</p>
